## Crop Production Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm in Machine Learning and Flask
This project aims to develop a web application using Flask and a Random Forest algorithm to predict crop production. The application will take various factors as input, such as weather data, soil conditions, and crop type, and then predict the expected crop production.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 and Flask installed on your machine. You can install these requirements using the following commands:

pip install python==3.8.10<br>
pip install flask<br>
Once you have the requirements installed, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/emanipavani123/Crop_Yield_prediction_Using_machinelearning.git<br>
cd crop-production-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
To run the application, you can use the following command:

## flask run
This will start the Flask development server on port 5000. You can then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to access the application.

## Using the Application
To use the application, simply enter the required information into the input fields and click the Predict button. The application will then predict the expected crop production and display it on the screen.

## Future Work
This project is still under development, and there are a number of things that can be done to improve it in the future. For example, the application could be improved by:

Adding more input factors, such as pest and disease data, to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
Developing a machine learning model that can predict crop production for multiple crops at once.
Deploying the application to a production environment so that it can be used by farmers and other stakeholders.
